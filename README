Kpackage handles RPM and Debian packages, it is used
for displaying currently installed packages, uninstalling
them and installing new ones. 

INSTALLATION
------------
It should be possible to do an installation by doing
	./configure
	make install
in the top directory.

For installing kpackage you need: 

       Qt 1.31 or above 
       recent KDE libraries 

For listing Debian packages no other software is needed but to install and 
unistall the packages you need: 

       the DPKG package manager installed 

For dealing with Redhat packages you need: 

       RPM 2.3.4 or above 
       RPM-Devel 2.3.4 or above 
       Ithe same libraries as compiling rpm does. These are: 
              libdb - the Berkley database library 
              libz and libz-dev  - compression library 
              Later versions of RPM require the gettext routine which is 
                found in libc6 or in libintl 

Also, for kpackage to work correctly with RPM packages the RPM database 
must be initialised. If typing `rpm -qa' gives an error about 
`unable to open....` then try `rpm --rebuilddb'.
